BigFrame
========

BigFrame is a benchmark generator for big data analytics, which means that it can instantiate different kinds of benchmarks.
Unlike the exsiting benchmarks, e.g TPCDS, HiveBench, etc. which are either micro-benchmarks or benchmarks in 
very specific domains, making them not fit into the big data enviroment taday, BigFrame can instead generate the 
bechmark tailored to a specific set of data and workload requirements.
 
For example, some enterprises may be grappling with increasing data volumes; with the variety and velocity of their 
data not being pressing concerns. Some other enterprises may be interested in benchmarking systems that can handle 
larger volumes and variety of data; but with the volume of unstructured data dominating that of the structured data 
by orders of magnitude. A third category of enterprises may be interested in understanding reference architectures 
for data analytics applications that need to deal with large rates of streaming data (i.e., large velocity of data).
